# Kidney Disease Prediction

This project aims to predict the presence of kidney disease based on various symptoms and demographics information using machine learning techniques.

# Overview 

Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a significant public health concern globally, affecting millions of individuals and posing substantial challenges to healthcare systems worldwide. Timely detection and accurate prediction of CKD progression are crucial for effective management and intervention strategies, aiming to mitigate its adverse outcomes and improve patient care.
Machine learning (ML) techniques have emerged as valuable tools in healthcare, offering promising avenues for early detection and prediction of various diseases, including CKD. By leveraging large-scale patient data, ML models can identify intricate patterns and risk factors associated with CKD onset and progression, enabling healthcare providers to make informed decisions and intervene proactively.
